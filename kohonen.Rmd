This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(kohonen)
data(wines)
set.seed(10)
plot(wines)
sommap <- som(scale(wines), grid = somgrid(3, 3, "rectangular"))  #create SOM grid
groups <- 3   # use hierarchical clustering to cluster the codebook vectors
som.he<- cutree(hclust(dist(sommap$codes[[1]])), groups)
plot(sommap, type = "codes", bgcol = rainbow(groups)[som.he])
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
