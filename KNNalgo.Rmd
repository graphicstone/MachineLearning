Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
library(class)
A1 = c(0,0)
A2 = c(1,1)
A3 = c(2,2)
B1 = c(6,6)
B2 = c(5.5,7)
B3 = c(6.5,5)
train = rbind(A1,A2,A3,B1,B2,B3)
train
cl = factor(c(rep("A",3), rep("B",3)))
cl
test = c(4,4)
result = knn(train, test, cl, k = 1, l = 0, prob = FALSE, use.all = TRUE)
result
summary(knn(train, test, cl, k = 1))
test2 = matrix(c(4,4,3,3,5,6,7,7), ncol = 2, byrow = TRUE)
test2
result = knn(train, test2, cl, k = 1, l = 0, prob = FALSE, use.all = TRUE)
result


```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
