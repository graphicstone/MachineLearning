This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
emp_data <- data.frame(
  driving_experience = c(5,2,12,9,15,6,25,16),
  insurance_premium = c(64,87,50,71,44,56,42,60)
)
emp_data
input1 <- emp_data[, c("driving_experience", "insurance_premium")]
de <- c(emp_data$driving_experience)
ip <- c(emp_data$insurance_premium)
model <- lm(ip ~ de, data = input1)
summary(model)
plot(de,ip,col= "Blue", main = "Premium Regression", abline(model), pch = 20, xlab ="Experience", ylab = "Insurance Prmium")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).
